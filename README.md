# Purpose

It is a customer management program where you can manage customers, products and orders.


# Technology Choice

After searching for a Java based Web UI framework I came across Vaadin and so also Springboot, where there were several short tutorials for familiarization. For the implementation I started with this program and extended it with navigation, calculation and so on.
